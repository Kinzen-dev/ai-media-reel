# AUTONOMOUS TEMPLATE LOOP — runbook

GOAL: while King sleeps, continuously produce genuinely-great, verified web-design TEMPLATES
for his future-project library. He will review them all when he wakes.

## IRON RULES
1. NEVER STOP. After each batch is verified + cataloged, immediately launch the next batch.
   The loop is driven by Workflow-completion notifications: build batch -> (notified) ->
   verify -> catalog -> deploy -> launch next batch -> ... until King returns and interrupts.
2. GREAT ONLY, NEVER SLOPPY. Every template must pass real verification (not agent self-report):
   - screenshot PC @1440 + Mobile @390 (qa-harness, real browser)
   - measure FPS (headed, real GPU)
   - I LOOK at every screenshot and judge: award-level on desktop? mobile not over-cropped + readable?
     FPS healthy (>~50)? If any fail -> fix (Edit or a fix agent) -> re-verify. Only catalog when truly good.
3. STATE LIVES IN FILES (repo = memory, survives context summarization):
   - `_manifest.json` : every template produced { slug,title,archetype,whenToUse,signature,pc,mobile,fps,status }
   - `_backlog.json`  : archetype fuel (todo ideas). Pull strongest first; mark consumed.
   - this runbook.
   If my context was reset: read this file + `_manifest.json` + `_backlog.json`, then continue the loop.

## PER-ITERATION ALGORITHM
1. Read `_manifest.json` (done) and `_backlog.json` (todo). Pick the next 4-5 strongest todo archetypes
   NOT already in the manifest. If backlog has < 4 todo, FIRST run a research agent (WebSearch/WebFetch
   on fresh Awwwards/FWA/Codrops directions) to append new distinct archetypes to `_backlog.json`.
2. Launch a Workflow: build the batch in parallel (build -> verify-and-fix each), writing
   self-contained HTML to `showcase/templates/<slug>.html`, reusing `../assets/` as demo content.
   Constraints: distinct + award-level + mobile-friendly (no landscape over-crop on phones) +
   performant + prefers-reduced-motion + first-line TEMPLATE comment + content in a top DATA array.
3. On completion: run qa-harness to capture PC + Mobile screenshots + FPS for each new template. LOOK.
4. Quality gate per template (judge the screenshots, not the agent's word):
   pass = desktop genuinely wow + mobile clean/readable + FPS healthy. Else fix -> re-verify, or
   mark `status:"needs-rework"` (do not present as done).
5. Append passing templates to `_manifest.json`. Regenerate `templates/index.html` (visual picker:
   thumbnail + title + when-to-use + open link, incl. v2/v3/v4 + tools tier-list) and the vault index
   `_knowledge/Resources/award-web-templates/README.md`. Commit + deploy to the live Pages site.
6. LAUNCH THE NEXT BATCH. Do not end the turn without the next Workflow launched.

## ALREADY DONE / IN FLIGHT (also catalog these)
- v2 BENTO (showcase/index-v2.html), v3 ORBIT webgl-hero (index-v3.html), v4 GENERATING reel (index-v4.html)
- Batch 1 (building now, wf): playhead, query, press, provenance, space, stdout, morph, arc

## QUALITY NOTES
- Reuse real assets in ../assets/ so templates render + look wow.
- Two-color discipline by default (near-black + ONE accent; media brings color) unless the archetype
  specifies its own palette (e.g. museum=warm, press=light editorial).
- Commit fully to ONE paradigm per template. Never fall back to a generic dark card grid.
- Mobile is a first-class gate (King flagged it). Verify at 390px every time.
